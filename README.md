# Sysadmin_Devops Track
This repository contains projects for training in the sysadmin-devops track at [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com). All projects are in bash and are designed to learn bash from a beginners level to the advanced level. 
## Styling and Specifications
All programs are run on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
All bash scripts require execution permissions:
```
chmod u+x file
```
### Directories
Each directory is named after a concept and contains ordered exercises from mandatory to advance level, and a README.md with a short description of its files.
